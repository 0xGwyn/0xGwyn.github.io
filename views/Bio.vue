        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
        With a strong interest in understanding the underlying concepts of information security, I have dedicated the past several years to developing my expertise in various areas of computer systems security.
        My academic and practical experiences span fundamental areas such as programming, networking,
        operating systems (with a strong focus on Linux), and web applications. Iâ€™ve also engaged with advanced topics, particularly in identifying and mitigating web application vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            Recently, my focus has shifted toward the defensive side of security, particularly security analysis by completing <a style="color: #ff5733" href="https://tryhackme.com/p/0xGwyn" target="_blank"> TryHackMe</a> rooms, where I am especially
        interested in proactively identifying threats and strengthening system defenses. I also recently reached top 1% ranking globally on this platform which really motivated me to maintain my activity streak.
