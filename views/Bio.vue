            Hello! I'm a {{ new Date().getFullYear() - 2000 }} year old guy passionate about ethically breaking and securing stuff. Over the past years, I have been dedicated to expanding my skill set in various areas including programming, networking, linux, databases, and web applications and their vulnerabilities. I have successfully completed projects that demonstrate my capabilities that are present in the <b class="font-bold">Projects</b> folder.

            Additionally, I have gained invaluable experience by participating in Bug Bounty programs, engaging in vulnerability discovery and assessment, as well as developing related tools for such tasks. I also have played the role of a Teacher Assistant in the Computer Networks course at Shahid Chamran university.
